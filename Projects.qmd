## 1: Predicting COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among US Adults Using Classification Algorithms

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
The primary focus of this project revolves around predicting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among adults in the United States. To achieve this objective, I employ classification machine learning algorithms and analyze data sourced from the [Household Pulse Survey data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html). Through rigorous examination and interpretation of the data, I aim to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of vaccination patterns and behaviors among the US population.....[Continue reading](projectscontent/Project%201/VaccineHesitancy_PBB.pdf){target="_blank"}

## 5: Effortless Access to Household Pulse Survey Datasets with `hpsr`: An `R` Data Package.

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
This project focuses on the development of an R data package- ['hpsr'](https://prasadbhoite.github.io/hpsr/), employing tools such as usethis, Rtools, and R Studio.\
The methodology involves downloading CSV files from the Census website, optimizing storage efficiency through Parquet conversion and easy storage on Github, further transforming these files into .rda datasets. The culminating step involves sharing the comprehensive package on GitHub as an open-source contribution to the field of data science......
