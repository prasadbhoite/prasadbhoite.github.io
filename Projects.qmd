## 4: Predicting COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among US Adults Using Classification Algorithms

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
The primary focus of this project revolves around predicting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among adults in the United States. To achieve this objective, I employ classification machine learning algorithms and analyze data sourced from the [Household Pulse Survey data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html). Through rigorous examination and interpretation of the data, I aim to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of vaccination patterns and behaviors among the US population.....[Continue reading](projectscontent/Project%201/VaccineHesitancy_PBB.pdf){target="_blank"}
