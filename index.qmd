Hi ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Prasad

I am a Lead Data Scientist at Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Florida International University, Miami, USA.

I am a foreign medical graduate with a unique educational background comprising clinical, social, statistical, and computational studies. I lead the data team and oversee statistical and machine learning projects funded internally by the university, the state of Floida, and other funding clinical institutions.

I enjoy displaying the value of analytics using tools such as Python, R, SQL, ArcGIS, MS-PowerBI, Atlas.ti, MS-Azure. I have extensive experience and expertise in Data Management, Machine Learning, Business Intelligence, and Statistical & Predictive Analytics.

Thank you for visiting!
