### Hi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25"/> , I'm Prasad! <br>

I am a Senior Data Scientist Manager with 10+ years of experience building AI and machine learning solutions in healthcare and public health. I lead a data team at the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Florida International University, overseeing ML model development, predictive analytics, and AI-driven research projects funded by the university, the state of Florida, and external institutions.

My background combines clinical knowledge, statistical expertise, and computational skills, allowing me to design end-to-end AI/ML pipelines, from data engineering and feature engineering to model deployment and visualization. I am experienced in Python, R, SQL, MS-Azure, PowerBI, ArcGIS, and modern ML frameworks, including hands-on work with Generative AI, LLMs, and predictive modeling.

I am passionate about leveraging AI to solve complex problems and delivering high-impact, scalable solutions that bridge research and real-world applications.

Thank you for visiting!
